Camera Calibration and Object Dimension Estimation Results
==========================================================

1. Camera Calibration Results
-----------------------------

Number of calibration images used: 25
Chessboard pattern: 9 x 6 inner corners
Square size: 28.6 mm

Camera Intrinsic Matrix (K):
[ 914.4210    0.0000  638.4210 ]
[   0.0000  915.5115  363.1515 ]
[   0.0000    0.0000    1.0000 ]

Distortion Coefficients:
k1 =  0.1208
k2 =  0.4948
p1 =  0.0003
p2 = -0.0007
k3 = -3.8663


2. Object Measurement Experiment
--------------------------------

Object used: Orange board
Camera-to-object distance (Z): 2.5 meters

Pixel Measurements:
Pixel width  = 84 px
Pixel height = 209 px

Computed Real-World Dimensions:
Measured width  = 0.1837 meters
Measured height = 0.4566 meters


3. Ground Truth and Error Analysis
----------------------------------

Actual object dimensions:
Actual width  = 0.177 meters
Actual height = 0.4425 meters

Percentage Error:
Width error  = 3.8 %
Height error = 3.2 %


4. Remarks
----------

The estimated real-world dimensions closely match the ground truth
measurements. The remaining error can be attributed to manual pixel
selection, minor camera-object misalignment, and lens distortion effects.
Overall accuracy is within acceptable limits for a smartphone-based
camera calibration and measurement system.
